# The Masked Fool, Sparkle

Honkai: Star Rail's (in)famous debutante skips into the Spire for a holiday!

Expect randomness and shenanigans.

---

Many cards function off of random amounts of damage, which can be increased two ways:

### Variance

Variance reduces the minimum and increases the maximum of a random number. A card that deals 3-5 damage, with 2 variance, would instead deal 1-7.

### Loaded Dice

Loaded Dice increase the minimum and maximum of a random number, after Variance. So a card that deals 3-5 damage,
with 2 Loaded Dice, would instead deal 5-7. And a card with 3-5 damage, and 2 each of Variance and Loaded Dice, 
will instead deal 3-9. 

### Fixed

The randomness of Fixed cards is unaffected by Variance and Loaded Dice.

## Other Important Keywords

### Unexpected

Unexpected cards repeat their actions for each stack of Unexpected you have,
then you gain a stack of Unexpected. Unexpected is removed at the 
beginning of your turn.

### SoulGlad

Too much sugar is bad for you! You take damage at the start of your 
turn equal to how much SoulGlad you have. It reduces by 1 each turn, 
similar to Poison, but cannot be prevented via Artifact.

### Mask

Mask prevents all damage (after block) from a single hit from an enemy, 
then on your next turn you randomly gain or lose one energy.
